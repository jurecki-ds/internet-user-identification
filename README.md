# internet-user-identification
This project was developed as a coursework of Machine Learning and Data Analysis Specialization (Coursera). There is an attempt to classify user by the visited internet sites sequences. This project was developed in Russian (it was necessary for peer review by other students on that ML course), but cells code is pretty clear and don't require russian language understanding.

Project was created in Jupyter Notebook, Python 3, and requests next installed modules: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, itertools, time, glob, os, pickle, collections and operator. You also need to install the Vowpal Wabbit library (https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki).

To use this project you just have to download and unzip files in any directory on your PC, and open the "Internet User Identification.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook. Then you may run project's cells to see the results of primary and visualization data analysis, classification algorithm selection, tuning parameters of selected algorithm and using this algorithm to identify specific user.
